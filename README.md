# Programming for Data Analysis

### Introduction
Project for the Programming for Data Analysis module using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.

### Description
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is a dataset that contains records of characteristics of the cell nuclei from a digitized image of a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a breast mass. It can be found and download at  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast%2Bcancer%2Bwisconsin%2B(diagnostic))

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To run this project locally you are going to need Python(and its packages: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn and MatplotLib) and Jupyter Notebook as well. You can gey both of Python and Jupyter by downloading [Anaconda]( https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
You may need to install/update some of the Python's packages.

You can use the code below to install/update your packages:
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install seaborn
```
```
pip install sklearn
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
